# Building-My-Own-Cpu
Just trying to build a basic CPU using my FPGA and Verilog.

## Introduction

### Why?

Because I wanted to learn microcontroller architecture and I bought an FPGA, so I decided to learn building my own CPU, and a seven segment display to show hex values.

### How?

I'm defining the characteristics of the project, meanwhile I'll post links, info and books I found.

### Next steps?

I will upload a "learnings" folder, where I will upload some tests I do with my FPGA and start defining the CPU characteristics.
